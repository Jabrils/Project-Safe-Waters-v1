# Project Safe Waters v1

## UPDATE: Im sorry, but I had to remove the Simple Simulator as I look into some licencing issues. Will provide a link to the compiled sim soon.

**I'm sorry, I tried to clean up this repo as much as I could, but it's still a bit of a mess, & some parts unclear. With bigger projects it becomes hard to ensure the project stays clean while completing the task, but I did the best I could to make it as good as I can. Leave any issues you have in the issues tab & I will try to address the problems as I see fit.**

Here is a link to the video that this repo was created from: [Machine Learning App can Save Your Life!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-uk9DtcOS8)
