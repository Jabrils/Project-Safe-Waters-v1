# Project Safe Waters v1

**I'm sorry, I tried to clean up this repo as much as I could, but it's still a bit of a mess, & some parts unclear. With bigger projects it becomes hard to ensure the project stays clean while completing the task, but I did the best I could to make it as good as I can. Leave any issues you have in the issues tab & I will try to address the problems as I see fit.**
